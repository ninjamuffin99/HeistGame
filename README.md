# HeistGame

### SOMEWHAT NSFW
An infinite runner game made with HaxeFlixel. This code is a little commented, but some comments may be misleading/out of date so be careful. Also if you go back to the commits before around Feb 18th 2018, the game was originally a turn based RPG! Some of that code is leftover.
